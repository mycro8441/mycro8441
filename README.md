# 🧠 @mycro8441 — builds models that question reality (and occasionally converge)

📚 Reads papers daily.  
🧪 Implements wild ideas before the coffee cools.  
🛠 Designs models like others write poetry — deliberate, weird, and sometimes beautiful.

🏆 Awards:  
- 2× **Minister’s Award** — Data Creator Camp (2023 & 2024)  
- 🥈 **2nd Place, Junction ASIA 2024**

## 🧬 What I do:
- Design emotion-aware LLMs (VAD flows + internal state modeling)  
- Prototype memory-augmented attention for long-term context  
- Experiment with architectures inspired by cognition, not just math  
- Run small-scale models with large-scale ambition

## 🔍 What I believe:
> “A model that can’t feel can’t truly understand.”  
> “Most papers are too safe. I like the dangerous ones.”
